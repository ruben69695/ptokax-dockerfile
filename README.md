# PtokaX in Docker
This is a Dockerfile to be able to build an image of PtokaX 0.5.3.0 (20th anniversary edition) and to create a container of the image. 

Base configuration for PtokaX under config directory in `Settings.pxt` text file, to be able to bind it for the container and preserve config between container recreations or to be able to create backups. 

**Settings** has been prepared to host a **private PtokaX Direct Connect Hub**, if we want to make it public, we have to change the `Settings.pxt` file.
